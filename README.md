# Algorithm Practice (C & Python)

This repository contains my algorithm practice based on *Grokking Algorithms* and other classic data structure problems.  
Each chapter contains:

- A **Python implementation**
- A **C implementation**
- A **notes.md** file including explanation, time/space complexity, and insights
- VS Code build & debug support for both C and Python

The goal is to enhance:
- Algorithmic thinking
- Low-level implementation skills (C)
- High-level prototyping (Python)
- English technical writing
- Git/GitHub workflow
